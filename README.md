# Celebrity Face Recognition using Machine Learning

This project classifies celebrity faces using image datasets and machine learning models. It involves image preprocessing, feature extraction using OpenCV, model training using Scikit-learn, and a basic frontend for user interaction via Flask.

# Tech Stack

- **Python**, **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn** (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest + GridSearchCV)
- **Flask** (REST API backend)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (frontend)
- **Joblib** (model saving)
- **VS Code**, **Git**, **GitHub**

# Model Performance

- Trained on ~70-80 images per celebrity (5 celebrities total)
- Accuracy Achieved:
  - **Logistic Regression**: 88.5%
  - **SVM**: 84.5%
  - **Random Forest**: 67.3%

# Features

- Real-time celebrity face recognition via image upload
- Multi-model training and comparison
- Interactive web UI for predictions
- Modularized with clean code and helper utilities
